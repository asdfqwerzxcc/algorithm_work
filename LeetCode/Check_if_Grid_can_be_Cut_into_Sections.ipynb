    "You are given an integer n representing the dimensions of an n x n grid, with the origin at the bottom-left corner of the grid. You are also given a 2D array of coordinates rectangles, where rectangles[i] is in the form [startx, starty, endx, endy], representing a rectangle on the grid. Each rectangle is defined as follows:\n",
