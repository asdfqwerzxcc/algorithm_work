    "The hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.\n",

    "For adjacent indices in the subsequence, their corresponding groups are unequal, i.e., groups[ij] != groups[ij+1], for each j where 0 < j + 1 < k.\n",
